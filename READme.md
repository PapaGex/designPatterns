**Singleton** - Focuses on limiting the amount of instantiated objects from a class

**Factory** - 

**Abstract Factory** -

**Composite** -

**Facade** - Facade attempts to mask the unnecessary details of individual 
interfaces and subsystems. Simplifies the interfaces for the user. Protects

**Chain of Responsibility** -

maintainability
